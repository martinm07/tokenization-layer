## Using Issues
If you've found an issue with the code, and an issue hasn't been opened concerning it already, create an issue yourself!<br>
If you can fix an issue with the code, open a Pull Request.

## Using Discussions
Use Discussions if you:
* Have any questions (`Q&A` tab)
* Have any ideas, mainly for what to do to improve the tokenization layer (`Ideas` tab)
* Have something generally to say (`General` tab)

## Making Pull Requests
Make a Pull Request for fixing an Issue, or adding something new, such as making new experiments (like `train_imdb.py`), 
adding new results (such as checkpoints of trained models), or even changing the core `TokenizationLayer` itself.
